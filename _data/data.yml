    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As part of my current role as a Budget Analyst at the SDSU Chinese Cultural Center, 
      I formulate, analyze, and manage budget revenue and expenditure with over 30 programs annually. 
      I gather and interpret data from a variety of sources to help the organization improve budget management efficiently. 
      I would love to automate internal and external reports, creating executive-level dashboards, and presenting information to help executives and others understand the operational impact of the budget. 
      With proven success managing department funds and resources as well as mentoring and supervising interns, my additional strengths in general administration position enable me to thrive in this challenging position. 
      In addition, as a data analysis intern at [SDSU Climate Informatic Laboratory](https://shen.sdsu.edu/research_group.html), I query and update database and routinely communicate progress and escalate issues to management, and assist in reviewing and writing Python code for the book entitled [Climate Mathematics: Theory and Applications](https://climatemathematics.sdsu.edu/main/PythonCodes.html).
